<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am software developer intern at BIMAR Arkas Holding,
  And also I am a senior student at computer engineering
  department of Katip Celebi University. Also I am a football
  referee in Turkish Football Federation (TFF).
  <br />
  I like running, watching TV series and movies, improve myself
  because I believe the idea that the most important investment 
  is the investment that you do for yourself.
  <br />
  Currently I am working as an intern in BIMAR Arkas Holding. 
  I am learning and experiencing a lot of thing such as work
  rules and ethics as an sociological way. And also I learned 
  and keep learning a lot of information about software 
  technologies. I am happy to do that because I am feeling the 
  self improvement.
